Inorder to log in to Click-Up your username and password must be
stored on your computer. The program needs to access this
information.(This is the whole point of this program.) Therefore
anyone with access to your computer and knowledge of this program can
get your Click-Up password and username. 
Therefore, please make sure that your Click-Up password is not the
same as your other passwords. I do not accept any resposibility for
keeping your credentials secure.

However, what I want to do is lessen your stress, not increase it. So
what I suggest is the following:
    During the exam period, change your password. I don't think
    someone could do much damage during this time (most assignments
    should be in by this time).
	Make sure your Click-Up password matches your gmail
	(u'sutdentnumber'@tuks.co.za) password. Update the credentials for
	this app. After all your marks are out change your Click-Up (and/or
	gmail) password. And (perminently) delete the "tmp/.credentials.csv"
	file.
